# Future Features

This simulation focuses on small scope, simplicity, and publicly available evidence.

The following features have not been prioritized or implemented.

Let's simulate these charities effects' on a simple model of a family.

## Win Condition

GiveWell scores by averaging doubling of income from the poorest.

To account for mourning the recently deceased, deceased members continue to be averaged at zero for their life expectancy.

All values normalized to USD PPP.

## End Condition
